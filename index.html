      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="video-editing" src="images/adobe.png" alt="Video Editing">
        <h3>Video Editing</h3>
        <p>I started learning how to video edit when I was 10 years old.
          After seeing Casey Neistat's vlogs, I documented my 13 year old life everyday for a year. It taught me how to edit, tell great stories, and stay committed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="cinematography" src="images/video-camera.png" alt="Cinematography">
        <h3>Cinematography</h3>
        <p>Cinematography is the art of camera movement. Dynamic camera movements drive the story forward. Without great cinematography, the film is left motionless, and ultimately, lifeless.
          I love finding new and innovative ways to practice camera jitsu. If you need help driving home your story, I'm exactly the man for that.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="photography" src="images/mirrorless.png" alt="Photography">
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I started to take pictures when I was 10 years old. An older friend of mine gave me a camera and it soon became my best friend. I took it everywhere using it wherever I went.
          Soon, I learned how to create beautiful compositions that tell a story through the lens.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="graphic-design" src="images/photoshop.png" alt="Graphic Design">
        <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
        <p>After photography, I began to learn how to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Another beautiful relationship emerged and graphic design became my next love. I would load the photos onto my laptop and spend hours editing them. Ultimately, it is the process, not the results, that are most important. It is in the process that we uncover a treasure trove of firey passion to fuel our evolution of art. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="web-development" src="images/computer.png" alt="full stack web Development">
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>My friend, Trevor, told me that web development was an important skill to learn in today's 21st century world. I agreed and decided to learn how to code. I fell in love with the process and it became another one of my skills.
          Creation is the name of the game.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="languages" src="images/earth.png" alt="Languages">
        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <p>I knew two languages at a young age: English and Vietnamese. Vietnamese was actually my first language and I spoke it boldly.... Until the day I stopped speaking it. The language became weaker and less used.
          Then, in 2015, by myself, I decided to study Vietnamese again. Language acqusition soon became another passion of mine. Currently, I'm in the process of acquiring Spanish!</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="writing" src="images/writing.png" alt="Writing">
        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>Writing is another passion that fuels my life. I love piecing words together to create the best delicious meal. The love of telling stories, to drive a message home, makes me fulfilled in every way possible.
          I love the process of creation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="master-chef" src="images/baker.png" alt="baker">
        <h3>Master Chef</h3>
        <p>In the end, my best skill is being a Master Chef. I am better than Gordon Ramsey and can cook 5 savory meals in 5 minutes. LOL, not really, but I can cook a banging meal. I love cooking for close friends and family members. There's nothing quite like the experience of eating with those whom you love. Sharing a meal and basking in the moment is truly a gift. In life, it's the small moments that matter. Because the small moments make up what is called Life.</p>
